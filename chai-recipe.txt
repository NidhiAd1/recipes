Recipe for Chai:

Ingredients:
2 tsp tea leaves/powder
1 cup of milk
0.25 cup of water
1.5 tsp refined sugar

Procedure:

1. Bring a quarter cup of water to a boil on medium-high heat on a stove top. 
2. When the water starts boiling, add the tea leaves/ powder to the boiling water. Reduce the heat in the stove to medium.
3. Simmer the mixture for 2 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, heat the cup of milk. (Optional)
4. After 2 minutes of simmering, you will notice that the water in the boiling tea-mixture  has reduced by some level.
5. Go ahead and add the heated milk to this tea leaves mixture. Maintain the heat at a medium level.
6. After a minute or two, when the milk starts boiling, remove the pan from heat and cover the top of the pan.
7. Let the tea sit for 2 minutes.
8. Now, sieve the tea leaves-milk concoction through a filter and into a tea cup.
9. Add sugar to the tea as per your requirement. I recommend 1.5 tsp. Stir well.
10. Enjoy your cup of chai.  :-)
